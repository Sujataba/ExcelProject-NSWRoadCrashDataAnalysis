## Overview:
The NSW Road Crash Analysis project is a comprehensive data analysis endeavor that delves deep into real-world data obtained from the NSW Transport website. 
This project aims to provide insights into road safety and accident trends over the past five years, focusing on various critical factors such as road conditions, weather conditions, road types, suburb types, and the number of fatal and serious injuries. 
By harnessing the power of data, the project seeks to uncover patterns, correlations, and trends that can inform policies and interventions to make NSW roads safer for all.



### Project Scope:

#### Data Collection and Cleaning:

The project begins by collecting a vast dataset of road crash records from the NSW Transport website.
Data cleaning processes are employed to remove duplicates, handle missing values, and ensure data accuracy and integrity.
#### Pivot Tables for Summary Analysis:

- Excel Pivot tables are utilized to summarize and aggregate the data, allowing for a quick overview of key statistics.
- Pivot tables are created to analyze accident trends over the last five years, breaking down the data by year, month, weekday and day time.
#### Conditional Formatting for Visualization:

- Conditional formatting in Excel is employed to visually highlight patterns and anomalies in the data.
- Attention is drawn to areas with a high incidence of accidents, facilitating a better understanding of accident hotspots.
#### Excel Calculations and Functions:

- Various Excel calculations and functions are applied to derive additional insights. For instance:
- Calculations helped to determine accident rates in different suburbs.

#### Correlation Analysis:

- Excel is utilized to perform correlation analysis to identify relationships between factors such as road condition, weather condition, and accident severity.
- Bar plots and heatmaps may be used to visualize these relationships.
#### Insights and Recommendations:

- The project concludes by presenting insights into the most significant factors contributing to road crashes in NSW.

#### Data Visualization:

- Excel charts and graphs are employed to visually represent the findings, making complex data more accessible to stakeholders and decision-makers.
- By leveraging the capabilities of Excel, the "Enhancing Road Safety" project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of road crash data, offering valuable insights and evidence-based recommendations for enhancing road safety measures in New South Wales.
